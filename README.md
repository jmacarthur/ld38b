Ludum Dare 38, plan B

This is a simple top-down racing game which uses OpenStreetMap data for its roads. The code here was written in one day and is posted publically for reasons of accountability. There is no suggestion that you should try and read or use this code, as it is very badly written, but you are welcome to try.
